"{'name': 'N/A', 'profile_url': 'N/A'}","Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Artificial intelligence refers to any system that is capable of performing tasks in ways we would consider intelligent. However, it's fundamentally different from human intelligence. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence and refers to algorithms that learn from data. Thank you, NTT DATA, Inc.",No comments

It’s that everywhere; it’s not just a trend anymore—people are really starting to use it a lot. 99% of marketers use AI every day, and 91% integrate AI into their daily work routines. That’s a lot! AI in advertising is no exception. Big tech giants like Meta, Coca-Cola, Amazon, and Google use AI to create designs and ads that better serve their customer base.If these companies use AI for ads, does that mean advertisers will be no longer needed? How can businesses use AI to improve leads? Importantly, what does the future look like?

But beneath the buzzwords lies a layered ecosystem, from the foundational concepts of Machine Learning and Neural Networks to the exciting promise of Generative AI and the elusive goal of AGI.What fascinates me most is not just the intelligence, but the explainability - can we trust what we don’t understand? Enter XAI, a critical bridge between algorithmic power and human judgment.This is indeed a powerful snapshot by Denis Panjuta, of the AI’s key pillars …… worth saving and revisiting as the landscape continues to shift. hashtag#AI hashtag#ML hashtag#AGI hashtag#DeepLearning hashtag#XAI hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#FutureOfTech hashtag#HumanMachineCollaboration",No comments

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) – Theoretical AI that mimics human intelligence, capable of reasoning, learning, and self-improvement.2. Explainable AI (XAI) – Ensures AI decisions are interpretable, bridging the gap between machine predictions and human understanding.3. Artificial Intelligence (AI) – Technologies that enable machines to think, learn, and act like humans in various applications.4. Machine Learning (ML) – AI systems that improve through experience, utilizing supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques.5. Neural Networks – Computational models inspired by biological brains, enabling pattern recognition and complex decision-making.6. Deep Learning – Advanced ML using hierarchical networks to process vast data, powering AI applications like speech recognition and image analysis.7. Generative AI – AI models that generate text, images, and other creative content, leveraging language models, transformers, and self-attention mechanisms.[Explore more in the post]If you found this helpful don’t forget to save this for later and comment your thoughts.Join my newsletter or send me a DM ""Newsletter” for more posts like this.Follow Denis Panjuta on Linkedin : https://lnkd.in/eUHjTBUi",No comments
